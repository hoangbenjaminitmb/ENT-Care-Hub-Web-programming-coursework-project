Part of my web programming module at Loughborough University, where I achieved 100/100 upon full completion. This website enables users to learn more about ENT consultants in the East Midlands, as well as clinics and about the private healthcare provider itself.

For employers that want to see this website in action, use the information stored on the enthubdata.sql file and upload it to your local PhpMyAdmin. After that, get the credentials, including server name, username, password, and database name, and put it into the placeholders found in database.php.
The entire website makes use of the PHP mysqli extension and data from my university's PhpMyAdmin.

I do apologise if the Mysqli funcitons are really messy for those reviewing the code, as this entire project is my first time working with PHP.
